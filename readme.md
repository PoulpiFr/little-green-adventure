# Little Green Adventure

This repository contains the "Little Green Adventure" game based on the [Solarus engine](https://github.com/solarus-games/solarus).

Many assets were taken from the Zelda "A Link to the past" game (I'm not a designer and this whole game was made in 48h with no prior experience with 2D Games).

## Tech used

- Solarus engine (see below)
- Lua scripting for all dialogs / logic
- GIMP for Tiles / Sprites creation / import (weirdly the hardest part...)

## How to run the game

On mac OS:
Run the "solarus-run" app.
